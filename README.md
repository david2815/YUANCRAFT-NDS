## About

**Minecraft: Nintendo DS Edition** is an adaptation (a semi-port) of everything that
[Eaglercraft Beta 1.7.3](https://github.com/PeytonPlayz595/Beta-1.7.3) brings, rebuilt for the
Nintendo DS family. It is not a wrapper or an emulator layer: the game is a native ARM9 program with its own
world generator, lighting engine, fluid simulation, mob AI, redstone, save system and menus,
all written to fit a console with **4 MB of RAM, no FPU, and a geometry engine capped at roughly 2,000
polygons per frame**.

The goal is to follow Beta 1.7.3 behaviour as closely as the hardware allows. Wherever the original
Java code could be consulted (via the decompiled Eaglercraft sources), the logic was ported from it rather than guessed,
and wherever the DS could not keep up, the deviation is deliberate and documented in
[Known differences](#known-differences-from-beta-173).

> **Status:** release candidate. The game is feature-complete for what the hardware can carry and has been tested on
> emulators and real hardware. Bug reports are very welcome.

## Features

**World**
- Deterministic, chunked terrain (8 × 128 × 8 chunks) with Perlin noise, biomes (ocean, desert, forest, taiga, plains), trees (including
  the big oak and spruce shapes), cacti, dead bushes, flowers and tall grass
- Caves, bedrock floor, ore veins (coal, iron, gold, diamond, redstone, lapis), lakes, springs and dungeons with mob spawners
- The **Nether**: obsidian portals, a separate dimension with its own terrain, lava seas and a portal-linked 8:1 coordinate scale
- Day/night cycle, weather (rain, snow, thunderstorms and lightning), clouds, and a sun and moon in the sky (DS and DSi chunk modes)
- Beta-style fluids: flowing water and lava, obsidian and cobblestone generation, falling sand and gravel

**Gameplay**
- 36-slot inventory with persistent tool durability, 2×2 and 3×3 crafting, furnaces, chests, dispensers, armor and health
- Mining times, tool tiers, and the full tool and weapon set (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond)
- Farming (hoe, seeds, wheat, bread), fishing, bows and arrows, buckets, flint and steel and fire
- Redstone (wire, torches, repeaters, levers, buttons, pressure plates), pistons, TNT, note blocks, minecarts with rails, boats, signs, paintings
- Beds and sleeping, maps, compass and clock
- Four difficulty levels (peaceful, easy, normal, hard) with Beta's damage and regeneration rules

**Mobs**
- Pigs, cows, sheep (with dyeable wool), chickens, squid, wolves (tameable)
- Zombies, skeletons, spiders, creepers, zombie pigmen, ghasts and slimes, with the Beta pathfinding approach (A\*, capped for the DS)

**Console-specific**
- Dual-screen UI: the game on the top screen, hotbar, inventory, crafting and menus on the touch screen
- Two control profiles (**normal**, with touch-screen camera, and **xyba**, with button camera) and fully rebindable buttons
- Three chunk modes — **fast**, **ds** and **dsi** — to trade view distance for speed (see [Performance](#performance))
- World selection, multiple save slots, custom seeds, and settings that persist on the SD card
- Built-in profiler and debug screen for developers (off by default)

## Requirements

### To play

- A Nintendo DS, DS Lite or DSi with a **flashcart**, **or** an emulator
  such as [melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) or [no$gba](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm)
- An **SD card** with a working DLDI driver. The game stores worlds and settings in `/mcdsefiles/` on the card
- Real hardware is the target. The original DS (Phat) is the baseline for performance work, and running on a DSi unlocks the `dsi` chunk mode

### To build

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) with **devkitARM** and **libnds**, including libfat/filesystem and `grit`.
  On Windows this is the standard devkitPro installer's *NDS Development* option; with `dkp-pacman` you can install it with:

  ```sh
  dkp-pacman -S nds-dev
  ```

## Building

The project uses the standard devkitPro NDS Makefile layout.

```
EaglercraftDS-1.7.3/
├── source/       C++ sources and headers
├── graphics/     PNG textures and grit conversion settings
├── tools/        Build helpers (alphakey)
├── Makefile
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

1. Install devkitPro and make sure `DEVKITPRO` and `DEVKITARM` are set (the installer does this for you).
2. Open the devkitPro **MSYS2** terminal (or any shell where those variables are set).
3. Clone the repository and build:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JohanGCX/EaglercraftDS-1.7.3.git
   cd EaglercraftDS-1.7.3
   make
   ```

4. The result is `EaglercraftDS-1.7.3.nds` in the project folder (the name follows the folder name).
5. To rebuild from scratch: `make clean && make`.

Notes:

- The build converts the PNGs in `graphics/` with `grit`. For the terrain and item atlases it first runs `tools/alphakey`, which turns
  PNG transparency into the magenta key colour (`FF00FF`) that the DS needs. This keeps standard RGBA texture packs usable.
- Main RAM is almost fully used. Rarely used code (menus, saving, redstone, …) is compiled with `-Os` on purpose. Please keep that in mind when
  adding code. A build that overflows main RAM fails at link time.

### Windows, Linux and macOS

devkitPro officially supports Windows, Linux and macOS, and the game source is plain C++ with libnds, so the project is not tied to one platform.
The only helper tool is `tools/alphakey`, whose source (`tools/alphakey.c`, using the public-domain `stb_image` headers) is portable C. The Makefile picks the right one automatically:

- **Windows (devkitPro MSYS2):** uses the prebuilt `tools/alphakey.exe`
- **Linux and macOS:** compiles `tools/alphakey.c` once with the system C compiler (`cc`, `gcc` or `clang`), the first time you run `make`. If you have no compiler, install one
  (for example `sudo apt install build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu, or the Xcode command line tools on macOS)

> Windows is the platform the project is developed on. The Linux and macOS path follows the same devkitPro toolchain, but it has had less testing.
> If you hit a problem there, please open an issue.

## Installing and running

1. Copy `EaglercraftDS-1.7.3.nds` to your flashcart's SD card (or open it in an emulator).
2. Launch it from your flashcart menu. On first run the game creates `/mcdsefiles/` on the SD card:

   ```
   /mcdsefiles/
   ├── options.dat           Settings
   ├── controlsprofile.dat   Button bindings
   ├── skins/                Player skins
   └── worlds/world1, …      Saved worlds
   ```

3. Choose **New World** or select an existing one, and play.

Worlds are saved when you leave through the pause menu. Use the in-game menu to exit rather than turning the console off.

## Controls

Default bindings of the **normal** profile (the camera is moved by dragging on the touch screen):

| Action | Button |
|---|---|
| Move | D-pad |
| Jump | A |
| Sneak | B |
| Break block / attack | R |
| Place block / use item | L |
| Toggle third person | Y |

The hotbar, inventory and crafting are used with the stylus or your finger on the bottom screen.
The **xyba** profile moves the camera with the face buttons instead of touch. Every action can be rebound in
**Options → Controls**.

## Options

Open the pause menu and choose **Options** (also available from the title screen).

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| difficulty | Peaceful, easy, normal or hard |
| controls | Control profile and button bindings |
| auto jump | Jump automatically over one-block steps |
| chunk mode | `fast`, `ds` or `dsi` (see below). Changing it in game reloads the world around you |
| render | Geometry detail: `high`, `balanced`, `fast` |
| default seed / custom default seed | Random or fixed seed for new worlds |
| clockcompassinvupdate | Keep the compass and clock sprites updating in the inventory |
| particles / sound | Turn effects on or off |
| inventoryMap | New worlds start with a map in the last hotbar slot |
| debug options | Developer tools: debug chests, `spikes.txt` log, debug screen contents and shortcuts |

## Performance

The DS has very little memory and processing power, so the engine is built around a few ideas:

- **Chunk modes.** `fast` is the lightest (shortest view distance), `ds` is balanced, and `dsi` uses the extra speed of DSi hardware for
  longer view distance. On a regular DS, `dsi` is not available and is switched to `ds` automatically
- **Time-sliced work.** World generation, lighting, mesh building and saving are split across frames with a shared time budget so the frame
  rate stays steady
- **Display lists** for terrain, level of detail for distant chunks, view-based culling, hardware fog and a fixed-point-heavy design (no FPU)
- **A built-in profiler.** *Options → debug options* lets you show it on the debug screen (open it with the touch
  screen mini-button) and optionally log slow frames to `/mcdsefiles/spikes.txt`

## Known differences from Beta 1.7.3

This is a port to very limited hardware, so some things are intentionally different:

- Chunks are 8 × 8 blocks (instead of 16 × 16) and view distance is short. Terrain, caves, lakes and structures are scaled to match
- The Nether terrain is a simplified version of the original generator (2D noise) for performance
- Animals and hostile mobs are not saved with the world, to save space on the SD card. Tamed wolves are saved
- No background music (disabled for performance). Sound effects are a reduced set
- No stars or sunrise/sunset glow in the sky. The sun and moon are shown only in `ds` and `dsi` chunk modes, at a shorter distance
- Leaves do not block light; only water and ice do
- The map is carried in the hotbar (as on the Legacy console editions) instead of being shown on the lower screen
- Some textures were reduced to fit in video memory

## Roadmap

- More testing of the Linux and macOS build
- More mob and block polish, and further optimization of mob rendering
- Documentation for contributors

## Contributing

Bug reports, performance traces and testing on real hardware are the most useful contributions. When reporting a problem, please include:

- Your console model (DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS) and whether you use a flashcart or an emulator
- The chunk mode and render setting in use
- Steps to reproduce, and the contents of `/mcdsefiles/spikes.txt` if the problem is about performance (enable it in *Options → debug options*)
